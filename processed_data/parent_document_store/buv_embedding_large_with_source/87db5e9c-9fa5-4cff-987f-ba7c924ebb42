You are joining at a historic and exciting time for the University and the country.  \nOur world is becoming ever smaller, and trade is more global than ever before. If we are to succeed in commerce, we need to have a sound understanding of the theory and practice of business across the world\u2019s cultures and environments. By joining us in this learning journey, you are well positioned for a prosperous and successful future. As an ambassador for the University, I urge you to commit yourself to your studies and to the broader university experience. With the right mindset, hard work and guidance from our academics and support staff, you can also join the proud community of BUV students who have graduated with a First-Class Honours Degree.  \nI feel privileged to be part of this University and I greatly value my role as Vice-Chancellor and President. As you study, I will be working with the UK and Vietnamese Governments, as well as commerce and industry, to ensure that the University produces new knowledge that is pertinent to the development of Vietnamese communities and, more broadly, higher education in Vietnam.  \nYou are entering a new and exciting phase of your lives, please study hard, take pride in your university and, most importantly, enjoy your life as a BUV student.  \nProf. Ray Gordon PhD., MBA, CPA, FAIM  \nVice-Chancellor and President", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "5"}, "type": "Document"}}
