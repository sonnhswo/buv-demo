For the most beneficial and meaningful PSG experience, students are expected to demonstrate active participation through both quantity (earning the minimum required points) and quality (engaging in a diverse range of activities). You can choose to focus on one quadrant or more depending on your interests and schedules, but it is important that you earn points in all four quadrants. Please note that you are subject to getting points in four quadrants only, not all 16 categories under the quadrants.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "17-18"}, "type": "Document"}}
