Please ensure you do not wait until the last minute to carry out your submission; computer problems can happen any time and this will not be accepted as an excuse for late submission. This includes internet connectivity issues.  \nWhen submitting text-based assessments, you MUST leave yourself enough time to check the levels of similarity using Turnitin and change your assignment if you realise that you have accidentally plagiarised.  \nYou are strictly forbidden from sharing your individual assignments or group assignments to other students. If you or your team member(s) have done this, there is a very high probability that the Turnitin similarity index will significantly increase, even after the deadline.  \nPlease note, there is no \u201csafe\u201d similarity index. This is just a tool to help marker to consider whether there is academic misconduct during marking process. You should speak to your module leader if you have any concern about similarity index of your work.  \nView this video to see how to upload to Canvas: https://buv.instructuremedia.com/embed/6fac2d4e-8574-4c80-8d74-c0b764b08225  \nWhen you finally submit your assignment, it is in your best interests to save and/or print a copy of your online submissions receipt to prove that you have submitted your assignment on time.  \nFor special submissions such as those for the Contemporary Creative Practices, Computer Science and Computer Games Design and Programming programmes you should follow the instructions on the assessment paper itself. If in doubt, seek advice from your Module Leader or Programme Leader.  \nIf you feel that you are not able to submit your assessment on time, you should speak to your Module Leader who will help you to work out how you can hand-in on time or send email to examoffice@buv.edu.vn for further instruction.  \nIf unexpected circumstances which you could not have planned for have happened, you may be able to claim for exceptional circumstances to be taken into account.
