Points will be updated automatically, so please check your PSG records frequently for updated points and contact PSG Administrator if you have any questions.  \nSimilarly, The Student Academic Support (SAS) Department will collaborate with other academic departments to collect, verify, and send Academic Merit Award information to PSG Administrator. Once we receive the list from SAS, we will send confirmations to students who received the Academic Merit Award via email, then update the points automatically. If you receive an Academic Merit Award as per criteria set by the academic department, you will receive 20 points/semester at the maximum.  \nYou can contact PSG Administrator at psg@buv.edu.vn if you have any other questions about PSG Programme and its activities under the four quadrants and 16 categories, and we will answer your questions or direct you to the appropriate department for assistance.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "23"}, "type": "Document"}}
