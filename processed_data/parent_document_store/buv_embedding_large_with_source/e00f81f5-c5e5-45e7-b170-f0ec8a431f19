In times of difficulty, you might apply for a Break-in-Study to put a temporary hold on your study and return when you are ready to perform at your best ability again.  \nEvery student is allowed to have minimum 01 term and maximum 01 year of Break-in-Study. However, you need to keep in mind a few things before deferring:  \nYou are strongly advised not to take a Break-in-study within one month of the main assessment period at the end of a module or group of modules.  \nCheck if your course will be available at the period you intend to return.  \nWhen you return, you will need to re-study any incomplete modules because any previous marks on these modules will be cancelled. This rule also applies to 30-credit modules.  \nYou will study with a whole different group of classmates which might be a challenge on its own.  \nWe highly recommend you seek advice from, Learning Support team and/or Discipline Lead before making any decisions. The detailed process will be explained to you by a Student Information Officer when you officially request for a Break-in-Study/ Deferral.  \nPLEASE NOTE:  \nIFP/ UOL students must strictly follow UOL Rules and Regulations on Break-in-Studies/ Deferral.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "23"}, "type": "Document"}}
