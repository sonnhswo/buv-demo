What is the reason for this?  \nWorkshop attendance is counted when you follow the attendance rules. Specifically, you need to check in within 15 minutes before/after the workshop starts and check out within 15 minutes before/after the workshop ends. There is no need for the students to self-report their attendance because the following processes are applied:  \nIf the activity is on BUV campus, the check-in/checkout must be done via the Facial Recognition system so that the attendance can be automatically recorded.  \nIf the workshop is on Canvas (online), the check-in/checkout is automatically recorded on Canvas as the students log in with their BUV accounts and stay attentive during the time frame.  \nIf the workshop is off campus (i.e. outside BUV), the attendance will be recorded and verified by BUV staff or the activity\u2019s organisers. You may have to send us your evidence for external activities' participation.  \nAlso, there are activities where points are only recognised if students complete the assigned tasks or follow-up work. The specific attendance requirements for different activities will be included in the announcements of the respective activities. Please keep in mind these processes to make sure your attendance is well-recorded for PSG points.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "19-20"}, "type": "Document"}}
