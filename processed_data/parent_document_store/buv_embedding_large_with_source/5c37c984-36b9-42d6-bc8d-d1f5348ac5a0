It is also any actions which could undermine the fairness of assessment and research at the University.  \nThere are different types of academic misconduct. You can find a list at: https://www.staffs.ac.uk/legal/policies/types-of-academic-misconduct.jsp  \nIf your lecturer believes that you have committed academic misconduct, they will gather all evidence and inform your Programme Leader. The evidence will normally include the Turnitin Report, if this is relevant, and any sources which your we believe you have copied from. If the allegations relate to cheating in an exam, we will include the examination certificate.  \nIf your Programme Leader and person identifying the misconduct judge that the instance is likely to be a minor one, as set out in the List of sanction, we will deal with your case informally. If it is considered that your case is more serious, we will ask you to attend a formal meeting that you can find more detail at: https://www.staffs.ac.uk/legal/policies/academic-conduct-procedure.jsp  \nPoor Academic Practice is not academic misconduct. Poor academic practice happens when you have used too much of other people\u2019s works in your assessment. Alternatively, it is most likely that you have not understood how to reference your work properly. In this case, there should be no evidence that you have tried to gain an unfair advantage in your assessment. If we feel that your work contains poor academic practice, we can discuss this with you and advise on how you can improve in future performance. Because poor academic practice has no penalty, students are not recommended to appeal to this decision. Appeal to poor academic practice can be interpreted that students disagreed with the panel and want to reconsider for Academic misconduct.  \nMitigating Factors for Consideration in Assessing a Case  \nEach of the points below may have an impact on the case outcomes and should be used by the panel to assess the severity of the case.  \nWhether the student has committed academic misconduct before.  \nHow far the student is into their academic journey.  \nWhat the impact of the academic misconduct on the mark awarded is.  \nWhether the academic misconduct is widespread across a range of modules.  \nWhether the student has admitted the offence in the first instance.  \nWhether there is evidence that the student committed academic misconduct on purpose.  \nWhether the student had personal circumstances which affected their decision making at the time.  \nExample: A student who has started recently, has committed no previous offences and found on one module not to have accurately reflected content in their referencing is likely to be a minor case compared to a student in their 2 or 3 years of study.  \nTable of Sanctions  \n| Instance | Range of sanctions which can be applied |\n| - | - |\n| Minor instance. Normally a first offence and limited to a single module. | Failure of the assessment. You will be reassessed, should an opportunity exist. Or Failure of the module concerned with a right to be reassessed should an opportunity exist. |\n| Major instance Normally a second offence or an offence which is widespread across multiple modules. | Failure of the module concerned with a right to be reassessed should an opportunity exist. Or Failure of the level. All of the marks will be wiped clean, and you will re-start the level at the next opportunity. |\n| Serious instance. Normally a second or third offence or any instance of contract cheating/impersonation. | Failure of the award and/or termination of your studies at the University. Your ability to reapply and enroll again at the university may also be restricted, normally for two whole academic years. |  \nAppeal to decision of the Panel  \nIf you feel that a decision on your academic conduct is wrong, you can appeal. You will need to put this in writing, to aca.compliance@buv.edu.vn or regulations@staffs.ac.uk with your evidence, within two weeks (excluding holidays) of the decision.  \nYou may appeal against an academic conduct decision for the following reasons which you must make clear in your appeal:  \nThat the procedure was not followed properly, and this has affected the outcome.  \nThat the decision reached was unreasonable due to bias or the harshness of the sanction.  \nThat you have new evidence which you were unable to provide earlier in the process for valid reasons.  \nThe Registry will check that your appeal is:  \nOn time, within 2 weeks (excluding banks holidays) of the decision.  \nMeets one of the reasons to appeal; and  \nIs supported by evidence.  \nIf your appeal does not meet all the above, we will not consider it and we will write to you explaining the reason.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "24-26"}, "type": "Document"}}
