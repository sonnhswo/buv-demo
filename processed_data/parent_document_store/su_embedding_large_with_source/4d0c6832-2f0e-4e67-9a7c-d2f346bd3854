This is called a re-sit. The Central Academic Information Services team will send the resit schedules via email to both the students and parents once the resit schedules are set up.\n\nIf a student passes the resit, he/she will be given a basic pass mark of 40% for the resit component. Late submissions will not be accepted. Students must pay the resit fee which is sent by the Finance department in line with the normal terms of the student\u2019s account.\n\nIf students fail their resit, the case will be brought to the External Examination Board to consider, and Chair of the Board will make decision on next action. The External Examination Board will base on the student\u2019s academic performance after student takes the resits and decide student\u2019s study plan, whether student can proceed, resit, retake module(s) or being withdrawn from the programme.\n\nEach student has 4 attempts of submisstion, including: (1) 1st sit of the 1st time study, (2) resit of the 1st time study, (3) restudy, (4) resit of the restudy. If the student fails at the 4th attempt, the student may be fail award as directed by the Examinations Board.\n\nN\u1ebfu sinh vi\u00ean kh\u00f4ng n\u1ed9p b\u00e0i, kh\u00f4ng \u0111i thi ho\u1eb7c kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ea1t \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c \u0111i\u1ec3m \u0111\u1ed7 cho m\u00f4n h\u1ecdc, sinh vi\u00ean s\u1ebd \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c giao m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ec1 b\u00e0i kh\u00e1c cho nh\u1eefng th\u00e0nh ph\u1ea7n ch\u01b0a \u0111\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ec3 ho\u00e0n th\u00e0nh m\u00f4n h\u1ecdc \u0111\u00f3 theo quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh c\u1ee7a H\u1ed9i \u0110\u1ed3ng Kh\u1ea3o Th\u00ed - hay c\u00f2n g\u1ecdi l\u00e0 thi l\u1ea1i.
