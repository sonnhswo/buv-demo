For example, every President and Vice President of clubs and societies will receive 120 points/one-year term if they effectively lead their organisations, manage members, and deliver outcomes that contribute to the university.  \nHowever, to ensure that students are fairly recognised for their comparative contributions and achievements and to encourage clubs and societies organise meaningful activities for other students, we will award bonus PSG points according to your level of participation in clubs and societies\u2019 events/projects that open to BUV community or/and the external community.  \nFor example: When a club or society organises a medium-sized event (with at least 50 participants) open to BUV students, the event leader will receive 40 bonus points. If that event leader is the President of the club or society, at the end of their one-year term, he or she can receive 120 base points and 40 bonus points. The more meaningful activities that clubs and societies organise, the more bonus points their organising team members and leaders can earn.  \nFurther details of the PSG point scheme for participation in student clubs and societies can be found in APPENDIX 2. PSG activity list and APPENDIX 3. PSG point scheme.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "22"}, "type": "Document"}}
