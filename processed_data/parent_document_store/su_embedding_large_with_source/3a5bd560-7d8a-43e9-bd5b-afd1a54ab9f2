BUV informs students/parents if students are absent for consecutive days without valid reason or in need of Academic, Behavioural, or Emotional assistance. All sessions shown on your timetable are mandatory, and you must prioritise your study at BUV over other demands of your time, such as part-time employment and social events.  \nOn some occasions, owing to illness or other unforeseen events, absence may be unavoidable. The process to submit absence request on some occasions is at:  \nFor plannable leaves, students should complete the absence application with the form and evidence submitted at least one day in advance of the absence date (for example: driving license test or family events...).  \nFor unforeseen matters, students should submit the documentation within three days upon the student\u2019s return to the University (for example: illness or accident).  \nThe absence application is only processed when the absence form and evidence are submitted to the Student Information Office on Level 2 or via email at studentservice@buv.edu.vn.  \nThe following list consists of common approved or unapproved absence reasons, apart from the below listed in Appendix A , other reasons will be carefully considered depending on the particularity of the circumstances to ensure the student's academic benefits.  \nStatistics of your attendance are recorded and monitored by the responsible Student Information Officer. To fulfil the attendance requirement for BUV, students are requested to be in the teaching room at the scheduled start time ready to study (\u2018ready to study\u2019 means students must have the relevant device with access to Kortext bookshelf, hardcopy books/case studies, equipment, pens/pencils and paper to write on).  \nStudents register attendance on the Facial Recognition System (FRS) up to 15 minutes before the start of the class and up to 4 minutes 59 seconds after the timetabled start of the class. Students also register attendance on the FRS up to 15 minutes before the end of the session and up to 4 minutes 59 seconds after the timetabled end of the session.  \nStudents must register attendance using the FRS for each session if they have consecutive sessions in the same classroom. Students do not need to register attendance if they leave and return during the session for toilet breaks. The session may be one, two or three hours as defined in the student\u2019s timetable.  \nStudents should also immediately inform the Student Information Officer about any FRS issue to have prompt support. Students are also required to take photos of the issue with the facial recognition machine and submit it as evidence to the email address: studentservice@buv.edu.vn within one working day of the issue date.  \n(\\*) It is not possible to retrospectively adjust attendance data automatically generated by the FRS, so it is important to register at the appropriate time.  \nThe absence leave request is separated and shall not be considered as \u201cExceptional Circumstances\u201d for any assessments. In case students cannot attend examinations or submit assignments and want to apply for Exceptional Circumstances (EC), they must follow the EC procedure, which requires filling in the EC form and providing evidence. Please contact Exams Office at examoffice@buv.edu.vn for further instructions.  \nBelow are possible consequences of intervention.  \nPossible consequences of intervention (applied for BUV/SU/UoL programmes)  \n| Intervention Level | Intervention levels apply to the absence rate (\\*) | Consequences |\n| - | - | - |\n| Level 1 | 15% | Students will receive the 1st warning letter. |\n| Level 2 | 25% | Students & parents/fee payers will receive the 2nd warning letter. |\n| Level 3 | 35% | - Students & parents/fee payers will receive the 3rd warning letter - Students will receive an invitation to a meeting with the Academic Recovery Panel (ARP) - Students will be placed on Academic Probation |\n| Students at level 3 and fails the Academic Probation | | Students will receive an invitation to a meeting with the Academic Recovery Panel (ARP).

This is classified as before, during and after classes.  \nBefore class:  \nIf students are given work to undertake in preparation for a class, it is important that this is completed in order to understand the subject and get the most out of the session. This may either be group or individual tasks and should be undertaken in the format outlined by the Lecturer.  \nDuring the class:  \nRude and disruptive behaviours will not be tolerated within classes, this applies to behaviours/actions which are deemed unacceptable to your fellow students as well as lecturers. Any such activity will be recorded and informed to Discipline Lead, and you may be asked to leave the class when this behaviour is repetitive or considered offensive by the Lecturer.  \nIf you are found to be disruptive, you will be asked to attend a meeting with the Lecturer andDiscipline Lead, where disciplinary action may be taken, including academic probation in very serious cases, or ultimately expulsion/suspension from University. Any meetings will be recorded, and notice will be sent to the fee payer/parent. Disruptive behaviour includes talking during presentations, using mobile telecommunications devices (when not permitted), not bringing relevant materials to study, talking during lectures among yourself (unless directed by the lecturer) and sleeping during class.  \nElectronic devices in class:  \nMobile phones may not be used in class at any time during lectures or tutorial sessions. The Module Leader will advise if tablets and notebook computers may be used in their classes. If tablets and/or notebook computers are permitted by the Module Leader they may be used for approved software applications only. Non-approved use will be recorded and will be subject to disciplinary action.  \nAfter class:  \nIf homework is given after class, you are highly advised to undertake it to the best of your ability and to submit it at the requested time. Failure to comply will result in this being recorded and kept on your study profile. Repeated failure will result in disciplinary procedures being undertaken by BUV.  \nUse of English:  \nBritish University Vietnam is an English-Speaking environment and in order to achieve the best results, English should be practiced at all times while on University premises. All formal communication between students and the University will be in English and all verbal requests and/or conversations between members of staff and students are also to be in English.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "18-22"}, "type": "Document"}}
