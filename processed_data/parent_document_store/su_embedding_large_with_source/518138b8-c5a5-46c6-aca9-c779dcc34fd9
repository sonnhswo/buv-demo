There may be differences in the number of points awarded for some similar activities in the PSG Programme compared to the PDP Programme.  \nFor example: If you participate in an extra-curricular class from July 2023 to December 2023 (After the PSG programme is officially launched), you will NOT automatically receive 150 points based on the PDP point scheme anymore. You will be awarded points in accordance with the new PSG point scheme depending on the duration of the class:  \n| Duration | Points |\n| - | - |\n| < 25 hours | 100 points/course |\n| 25 hours - 40 hours | 120 points/course |\n| > 40 hours | 150 points/course |  \nIf you meet all compulsory requirements to complete the PSG programme, you will be awarded a PSG certificate and a detailed PSG transcript with all activities and points accumulated throughout your time at BUV. All activities will be categorised into the new 4 quadrants and 16 categories of the PSG Programme instead of the 4 previous components of the PDP Programme (Skill Development, Work Experience, Extra-curricular Activities, Extra-curricular Classes):  \nQuadrant 1: Work and Career Readiness  \nQuadrant 2: University and Community Engagement  \nQuadrant 3: Social, Cultural and Emotional Development  \nQuadrant 4: Academic Excellence", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "16-17"}, "type": "Document"}}
