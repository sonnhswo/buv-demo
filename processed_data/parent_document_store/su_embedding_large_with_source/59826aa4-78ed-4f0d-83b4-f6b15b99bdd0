In the appointment, we can discuss several topics, from the very first step of an internship application process to how to respond professionally to a job offer (accept or refuse). We highly recommend you make the most of our support BEFORE you officially apply for jobs and internships.  \nDuring the Internship: Either you are interning at a BUV partner or not, we are here to advise and guide you on any difficulty or concern during and after the internship and any other form of involvement where necessary. We are staying in touch with you via email, phone calls, and in-person catch-ups.  \nInternship Recognition: After an internship or similar professional experience, you will need to submit a valid Internship Evaluation Form (IEF), approved by the Head of Student Engagement, to get PSG points. The Internship Completion Certificate which is not compulsory for your PSG Transcript will be only issued upon your request. The specific requirements of a valid IEF and how to request a Certificate will be sent to you every semester from BUV Career Services email.  \nFor our support, feel free to contact us via the email address BUV Career Services: SE-Careers@buv.edu.vn, book an appointment on BUV Booking Portal (Guideline on how to use the Booking Portal, please find at Career Information Hub) or find us at the SE Lounge.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "49-51"}, "type": "Document"}}
