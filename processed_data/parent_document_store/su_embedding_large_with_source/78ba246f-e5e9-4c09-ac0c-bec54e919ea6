This is called a re-sit.\n\nIf the student gets Exceptional Circumstance upheld, one of the following outcomes can be applied:\n\nFor Upheld Exceptional Circumstances Claims:\n\nIf you have submitted your work within one week of the deadline, it will be marked and counted as if it had been submitted on time. A successful Exceptional Circumstances claim can only extend your assessment hand in date by one week and only for assessments where this applies. For example, you cannot be offered an extension for an Exam that you were unable to sit. If you are unsure whether your assessment falls into this category, please speak to your course team.\n\nIf you were unable to submit your work, or you have received a failed mark, you won\u2019t be penalised if you are given another assessment opportunity. For example;\n\nIf you have ECs for your first assessment opportunity, and are given a resit opportunity, this would not be capped at the minimum pass mark.\n\nIf you have ECs for a resit opportunity the Award Board will need to assess your profile in keeping with the Academic Regulations. If they are in a position to offer you a resit opportunity but you did not have ECs against your first assessment opportunity, then the resubmission will be capped at a passing grade.\n\nIf you are given a third assessment opportunity and have ECs an Award Board will need to assess your profile and their decision will be released to you in your results profile.\n\nThe Award Board will not always be able to offer you a resubmission opportunity, for example, if the following apply.\n\nThe Award Board condones your failed assessment.\n\nThere are no resubmission opportunities remaining to you.\n\nYou have reached the end of your maximum registration period and have therefore run out of time to complete the course.\n\nIn these types of circumstances, the Award Board will make a decision on your progression in line with the Academic Regulations, and this will be communicated to you in your results profile.\n\nAcademic Decision Makers may decide not to uphold your claim for several reasons. For example, your circumstances do not meet the University\u2019s expectations of exceptionality, or your evidence does not meet the standard of acceptable evidence. Your assessments will then be considered at the Award Board as normal and standard Regulations will apply.\n\nIf the students are on the resit list, the Central Academic Information Services team will send the resit information via email to both the students and parents once the resit schedules are set up. Thus, the parents and the students are encouraged to check email regularly to receive notification from the University.\n\nSinh vi\u00ean c\u1ea7n ch\u1edd quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh cho \u0111\u01a1n xin x\u00e9t ngo\u1ea1i l\u1ec7 c\u0169ng nh\u01b0 k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 ch\u00ednh th\u1ee9c c\u1ee7a h\u1ecdc k\u1ef3 \u0111\u00f3.\n\nSau khi k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 ch\u00ednh th\u1ee9c c\u1ee7a k\u1ef3 h\u1ecdc \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00f4ng b\u1ed1, n\u1ebfu sinh vi\u00ean kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ee7 \u0111i\u1ec3m qua m\u00f4n h\u1ecdc v\u00e0 quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh t\u1eeb H\u1ed9i \u0110\u1ed3ng Kh\u1ea3o Th\u00ed l\u00e0 sinh vi\u00ean c\u1ea7n ho\u00e0n th\u00e0nh b\u00e0i thi l\u1ea1i, sinh vi\u00ean s\u1ebd \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c giao m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ec1 kh\u00e1c cho h\u1ecdc ph\u1ea7n ch\u01b0a \u0111\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ec3 ho\u00e0n th\u00e0nh m\u00f4n h\u1ecdc. \u0110\u00e2y \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c g\u1ecdi l\u00e0 thi l\u1ea1i.\n\nN\u1ebfu \u0111\u01a1n xin x\u00e9t ngo\u1ea1i l\u1ec7 c\u1ee7a sinh vi\u00ean \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ch\u1ea5p thu\u1eadn, m\u1ed9t trong c\u00e1c quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh sau s\u1ebd \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c \u00e1p d\u1ee5ng:\n\nN\u1ebfu sinh vi\u00ean \u0111\u00e3 n\u1ed9p b\u00e0i trong v\u00f2ng m\u1ed9t tu\u1ea7n sau h\u1ea1n n\u1ed9p, b\u00e0i l\u00e0m c\u1ee7a sinh vi\u00ean s\u1ebd \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c coi l\u00e0 n\u1ed9p \u0111\u00fang h\u1ea1n v\u00e0 ch\u1ea5m \u0111i\u1ec3m nh\u01b0 b\u00e0i n\u1ed9p \u0111\u00fang h\u1ea1n.
