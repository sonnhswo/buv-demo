Our Campus Lost & Found service is here to assist you. If you find property belonging to someone else, please bring it to Lost and Found service. If you would like to search for your lost item, please stop by our Campus Services Centre to fill out and submit the Lost and Found Form. All efforts will be made to ensure that lost/found items are returned to their rightful owners in a timely manner.  \nFound items are securely stored for a period of 1-3 months. However, perishable items, including food, soiled or unusable clothing, or personal items, are subject to disposal after just 1 working day due to sanitation concerns. After that period, any unclaimed items are either disposed of or donated. Your cooperation in this process is greatly appreciated as it helps us maintain a clean and organized environment and assisting those who have lost valuable belongings.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "62"}, "type": "Document"}}
