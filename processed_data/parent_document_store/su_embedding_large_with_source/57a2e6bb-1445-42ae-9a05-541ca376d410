The quality of your courses, the standard of academic excellence, together with the teaching and learning style are on the same level as other courses in any British university.  \nOur institutional partners in the UK have been working closely with the academic staff at British University Vietnam to ensure that your learning experience and the overall quality of your graduate degree are identical to of those students who are studying in the UK. It means you will not only study the entire course in English, but also learn to develop your own independent skills in: writing argumentative essays, delivering persuasive presentations, collaborating in teams and contributing in group discussion. You will be required to manage your time effectively, while continue to be an active learner and constantly contribute to your own personal development.  \nWe understand that you might feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable at the beginning of your study journey due to the differences between Vietnamese education and British education. However, we are confident you will eventually overcome these challenges and start to enjoy the new study style and education experience that our courses will bring to you. Should you have any concerns or questions during your study with BUV, please feel free to reach out to any member of our academic staff or directly to your Discipline Lead, whose presences are not just to deliver the course, but to support and ensure your success in the academic journey with BUV.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "6"}, "type": "Document"}}
