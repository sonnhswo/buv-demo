PSG certificate and transcript  \nAt the end of students\u2019 BUV journey, those who meet the criteria for PSG accomplishment will receive an official detailed PSG transcript along with a Certificate of Recognition. This is separate from their academic transcripts.  \nThe PSG transcript presents each student\u2019s achievements in their own PSG path: the activities, the contents and objectives of each activity, the duration of participation, and the number of points awarded. The transcript is neatly organised by category of activities and by academic semester, showing each individual\u2019s progress in self-improvement and the diversity of their pursuits. It is thus very important that students select and arrange their activities participation over the years in a meaningful way so that the PSG transcript can best reflect their initiatives and career interests.  \nThere are different levels of PSG accomplishments based on the total PSG points a student has earned, which will be specified in the PSG transcript:  \n| Total points | Classification |\n| - | - |\n| Minimum of 1200 | Platinum |\n| Minimum of 900 | Gold |\n| Minimum of 700 | Silver |\n| Minimum of 500 | Bronze |\n| Below 500 | Not qualified for Certificate of Completion and PSG Transcript issuance |  \nBoth the Certificate of Completion and the PSG transcript will be signed and stamped by BUV as official recognition of students\u2019 efforts in personal, social, professional, and academic development. If the Degree Certificate and the academic transcript represent mastery of specialised training in a field of higher education, the PSG certificate and transcript will endorse in-demand skills, essential qualities, and learning dispositions that distinguish a BUV student from other graduates.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "14"}, "type": "Document"}}
