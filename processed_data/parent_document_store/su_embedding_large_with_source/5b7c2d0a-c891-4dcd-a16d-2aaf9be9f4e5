However, is there a requirement for the specific number of points that I have to earn each year?  \nThe requirement is that you achieve at least 500 points during your whole time at BUV. This means that it does not matter how many points you get each year as long as you get 500 points or more in the end.  \nNevertheless, it is highly recommended that students pay attention to and make sensible plans for PSG participation each year. As an example, if your goal is to earn 500 points by graduation, you should earn 200 in your first year, 200 in your second year, and in 100 the last year(s). This not only motivates students to develop their organization and planning skills and exercise their proactiveness to participate in a comprehensive social and personal growth programme at BUV, but also instills in them a sense of independence, exploration and desire for progress.  \nYou can contact the PSG Team (psg@buv.edu.vn) and Career Services Team (se-careers@buv.edu.vn) for further guidance on planning your PSG journey.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "19"}, "type": "Document"}}
