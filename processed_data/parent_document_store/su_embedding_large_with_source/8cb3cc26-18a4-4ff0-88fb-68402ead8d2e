You will have the process explained to you in a formal meeting and your parents will be notified by letter. You will need to take an AP form with you to each class and the Module Leader or Lecturer for that class and Student Information Officer will confirm by signature that you have met the requirements of your probation in class. Completed forms are returned to the Student Information Office at the end of each week and a report will be prepared and submitted to the Dean of Higher Education.  \nThe AP system helps students to understand the importance of complying with the behaviour expected of a BUV student and if you complete the AP process successfully, you will be allowed to return to normal academic status. If you are unable to successfully complete the process successfully, the situation will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the Dean of Higher Education.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "28"}, "type": "Document"}}
