You are expected to study and complete assessments honestly. This means:  \nYour work is your own,  \nYou have acknowledged every source of information you have used,  \nYour research has been done ethically.  \nIf you do this, you will have good academic conduct. Good academic conduct is important for you. It is part of your development and without it, you are cheating yourself out of your own learning journey. In some cases, academic misconduct can lead to other processes such as the Student Disciplinary Procedure, where appropriate.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "23"}, "type": "Document"}}
