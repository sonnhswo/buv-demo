The idea of the PSG Programme is to promote students\u2019 well-rounded growth through diverse experiences outside the classroom. BUV, through the Student Engagement department, can draw on its rich resources and readily offer a lot of unique opportunities for students. However, students can proactively search for other opportunities that can be beneficial for them.  \nNevertheless, for any activities outside of BUV (e.g. competitions, community projects, online courses on Coursera, running a business, etc.), in order to get recognition by BUV in the form of PSG points, students must provide clear evidence of participation and/or achievement. The evidence must be in official writing (e.g. documents, certificates, portfolios, etc.) and may need to be signed/stamped/validated by relevant organisations, and should include a detailed description/reflection of how the activity has been done and contributed to the student\u2019s personal development. Without evidence, BUV cannot verify the authenticity and evaluate the effectiveness of any activity outside of BUV \u2013 how it is beneficial to the student and to BUV as an institution that endorses the student.  \nWhen you have a meaningful experience outside of BUV that you wish to register into your PSG records, kindly follow the instructions below:  \nEmail the PSG Administrator (psg@buv.edu.vn) with a brief description of the experience (e.g. what kind of achievement and what official documentation you have got). The PSG Admin will decide if the experience can be recognised with PSG points.  \nReceive an External Activity Report Form from PSG admin. Fill in the form with all the necessary information and detailed reflections on how the experience has benefited your personal and social growth.  \nSend the completed form along with all the evidence (pictures, documents, etc.) back to the PSG Administrator in the same email chain.  \n\\*The PSG Team is also developing an online function that allows students to register external activities into their PSG records on the Student Portal, we will let you know soon when the function is available.  \nKindly keep in mind that in reporting your external activities, you are essentially \u201capplying\u201d for BUV recognition with PSG points. As a result, please make a strong case for your achievement(s) with evidence and a meaningful reflection of the experience.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "18-19"}, "type": "Document"}}
