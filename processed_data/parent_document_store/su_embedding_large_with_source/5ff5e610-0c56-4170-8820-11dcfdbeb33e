This will take some time to complete, depending on the other commitments of the tutor. As soon as the assessment papers have been graded by the tutor, they will be second marked by another member of staff with relevant expertise, then a sample will need to be sent to an external examiner for further moderation. Once the marks have been returned by the external examiner, they will then be disseminated to each student confidentially.  \nRemember that all marks are provisional until they have been approved by an Examination/ Award Board. More details of the Staffordshire University assessment regulations and progression can be found on the Staffordshire University Web Site at:  \nhttp://www.staffs.ac.uk/legal/policies/  \nShould you fail a module, there are procedures in place to help you attempt the module again. The University regulation states that any student who fails to achieve the criteria for a pass will be awarded a referral and will be allowed one further opportunity for a re-sit. The maximum grade achievable is a pass grade for all re-sit papers. Please note that if a student fails a core module repeatedly, it can result in the student being unable to complete the award.  \nNumber of Assessment Opportunities  \nStudents have two opportunities (attempts) to submit each assessment. The first assessment is marked at the full grade point. The second assessment or re-sit assessment is limited to undergraduate passing grade 40R, in which indicates 40 grade point and referral. Further attempts are at the discretion of the examination board.", "metadata": {"file_name": "Student Handbook 2023-2024.pdf", "page": "33"}, "type": "Document"}}
