The University hopes that students wish to study hard for their own benefit, to optimize their achievement in qualifications and to enhance their future further study or employment. In addition to the Top student award and Dean award, there is also the opportunity to qualify for the BUV mobility scholarship which is to recognize the top 2 students of each academic year.\n\nThis is a matter for the students to decide and to set their own targets for achievement. The classification of the degree, the transcript, evidence of specific academic achievements and a record of extra-curricular activities are often valued by potential employers and serve to differentiate students in applications for employment and for continuing higher education.\n\nCh\u1ee9ng nh\u1eadn th\u00e0nh t\u00edch h\u1ecdc t\u1eadp xu\u1ea5t s\u1eafc \u2013 Top student v\u00e0 Dean award nh\u1eb1m ghi nh\u1eadn th\u00e0nh t\u00edch h\u1ecdc t\u1eadp xu\u1ea5t s\u1eafc t\u1ea1i BUV, kh\u00f4ng v\u1edbi m\u1ee5c \u0111\u00edch trao t\u1eb7ng ph\u1ea7n th\u01b0\u1edfng cho sinh vi\u00ean.
