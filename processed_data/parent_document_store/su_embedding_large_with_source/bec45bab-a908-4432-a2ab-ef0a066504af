To choose this option, students need to join a project with validated NGOs, NPOs, and social enterprises for at least 160 hours to get community-based work experience and make meaningful contributions to the community. Students also need to submit a professional experience evaluation form signed and stamped by the employer/supervisor to the Career Services team to be awarded PSG points. Those participating in this activity can receive from 100 to 200 PSG points depending on their participation duration throughout the project.  \nShort-term volunteering to help in the community is NOT considered one of the professional experience options or alternatives. Students will get points for this activity by acting as a volunteer who works for one-off or short-term voluntary activities and projects (For around 2 days and more), serving in the best interests of the community without receiving a financial reward. To be recorded points for this activity, students only need to follow the External Activity Report procedure outlined in Question 5 by sending evidence and reflecting on how the activity has benefited their personal and social growth instead of getting an evaluation form signed and stamped by the employer/supervisor. Depending on the participation duration of the activity, students can receive from 30 to 100 PSG points.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "21-22"}, "type": "Document"}}
