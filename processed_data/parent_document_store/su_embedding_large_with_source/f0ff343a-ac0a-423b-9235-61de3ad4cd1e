PSG points for programme participation  \nIn order to find details on the exact number of PSG points granted from a specific PSG activity, students can read APPENDIX 3. PSG Point Scheme. In some cases, a similar activity can grant students different numbers of points, depending on the activity\u2019s duration, each student\u2019s level of commitment and assessed performance.  \nThe PSG point scheme will be helpful for students to estimate PSG points on their own when exploring activity options, determine their standing in the programme, and plan their PSG journey to reach PSG rankings goals.  \nGiven the variety of potential activities that are eligible for PSG points award, for new events, projects, and programmes that do not conform to the pre-determined point scheme, PSG administrators will evaluate the impact of the activity and consider awarding respective PSG points on a case-by-case basis based on submitted evidence and evaluation.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "11-12"}, "type": "Document"}}
