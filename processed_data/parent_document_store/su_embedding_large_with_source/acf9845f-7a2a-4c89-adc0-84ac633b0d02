Simply initiating an idea or attempting to run a campaign to raise awareness on social issues, e.g., cyber-bullying or recycling, can already be a meaningful project for the students. BUV fully supports students to try new things and experience growth in the most active way possible.  \nMembers\u2019 contributions will be recognised by the Core Organising Team (Project Leader, or Heads of Functions) during an evaluation process after each project and event. This evaluation process ensures that the members/coordinators/officers contribute and learn efficiently during the event/project. After the evaluation, members/coordinators/officers can receive from 20 to 80 points depending on the level of contribution assessed by their leaders.", "metadata": {"file_name": "PSG Programme Handbook.pdf", "page": "22-23"}, "type": "Document"}}
